<time>19 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><span class=location>EXCLUSIVE -&nbsp;</span><p>Malcolm-Jamal Warner has been touring as part of a jazz tribute to <a href=#>A Tribe Called Quest</a> for a little over a year, but their impact on his life began decades ago.</p><p>The renowned actor told&nbsp;HipHopDX that his love for the iconic Hip Hop group started when he first saw the video for their 1990 debut single, “I Left My Wallet In El Segundo.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“It was weird. But at the same time it was almost a welcome weird, because it was different,” Warner said. “It wasn’t the typical aggressive ‘Arrr,’ but there was something. It was weird, but there was something fly about it.</p><p>“Just the beats and I guess the samples they chose, it just gave you a different vibe that I think Hip Hop at the time needed because it was different,” he continued. “I think that was the thing, how it would manage to be weird but not soft.”</p><p>When the&nbsp;Cosby Show grad and his wife made plans to attend Atlanta artist Dashill Smith’s live tribute “We Got The Jazz: The Jazz Of A Tribe Called Quest” in December 2021, Malcolm-Jamal Warner decided that he had to get involved with the performance.</p><p>“I hit Dashiell up like, ‘Yo, who’s playing bass?’ He told me Khari [Simmons] was playing bass,” Warner recalled. “Khari’s a friend of mine. I hit him up and was just like, my wife and I are coming to the show. And he said, ‘Well, why don’t you sit in on the tune?'”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>After accepting the invitation, he went back to Smith and asked if he could he could add one of A Tribe Called Quest’s verses to his guest set.</p><p>“So literally the very first show I come in, the audience doesn’t know anything,” he recounted. “I sit in, I play bass on “Bonita Applebum” and I do “Check the Rhime” with Dashiell. And the show was so fire that I basically ended up becoming a part of the show. And every time we did it, the show, I would just end up playing bass or more songs and splitting verses on more songs with Dashiell.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Malcolm-Jamal Warner added: “So I was the last addition to the show, and then just once I got on it. Just look at it this way. The show is a fire show on its own. And then when I came a part of it just went to a whole ‘nother level.”</p><p>While Warner’s second career as a musician may be news to some, he actually earned one of the most coveted awards in music in 2015, when he took home the Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance as a Featured Performer with his appearance on Robert Glasper Experiment’s “Jesus Children,” featuring Lala Hathaway.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>On Sunday (February 5), Malcolm-Jamal Warner is not only set to present at <a class=underline-link href=#>the 65th Annual Grammy Awards</a>, but he is also up for the award for “Best Spoken Word Poetry Album” for his 2022 release <i>Hiding In Plain View.</i></p><p>The nomination coincides with A Tribe Called Quest’s own milestone nod, announced earlier this week.</p><p>On Wednesday (February 1), <a class=underline-link href=#>The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation announced its list of nominees for the 2023 induction ceremony with Missy and Tribe leading the way for Hip Hop</a>.

Given that her debut album <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Supa Dupa Fly</a>&nbsp;dropped in July 1997, the Virginia native meets the criteria, which states that 25 years must have passed since an artist’s first commercial recording.</p><p>A Tribe Called Quest, meanwhile, was&nbsp;<a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>previously nominated last year but didn’t receive enough votes to be inducted</a>.
