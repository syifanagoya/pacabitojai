Unfortunately, no written text of Proto-Indo-European, or PIE for short, exists. However, again according to Rice University, in the 1850s and 1860s, linguistics scholars began to reconstruct sounds, words, and phrases of PIE; they discovered that its origins are centered on the Black Sea, from where it spread throughout Europe, the Near East, and even parts of India between 5000-6000 years ago.</description></item><item><title>Winnie Harlow Is Obsessed With Wearing Wigs: Im Never Bored</title><link>/winnie-harlow-is-obsessed-with-wearing-wigs-im-never-bored.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/winnie-harlow-is-obsessed-with-wearing-wigs-im-never-bored.html</guid><description>Whether she’s doing full-blown Barbie glam for a ~casual~ trip to the beach or getting prepped and ready for a photo shoot, Winnie Harlow always serves up a fierce look.&amp;nbsp;
