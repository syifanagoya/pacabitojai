Unfortunately, no written text of Proto-Indo-European, or PIE for short, exists. However, again according to Rice University, in the 1850s and 1860s, linguistics scholars began to reconstruct sounds, words, and phrases of PIE; they discovered that its origins are centered on the Black Sea, from where it spread throughout Europe, the Near East, and even parts of India between 5000-6000 years ago.</p><footer><a href=../../the-real-reason-so-many-countries-end-in-stan.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../winnie-harlow-is-obsessed-with-wearing-wigs-im-never-bored.html>Winnie Harlow Is Obsessed With Wearing Wigs: Im Never Bored</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
