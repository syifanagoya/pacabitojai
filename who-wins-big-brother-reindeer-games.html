They showed up for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reindeer Games</a>, an original CBS spin-off show nothing like its predecessor.</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>Instead of Head of Households, Power of Vetos, and eviction nights, the contestants dueled in a challenge-based game that played out through six festive <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">episodes</a>.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>All in all, five former Big Brother champions joined the roster — Nicole Franzel-Arroyo, Taylor Hale, Xavier Prather, Josh Martinez, and Cody Calafiore — as well as four fan favorites: Frankie Grande, Britney Godwin, Danielle Hendricks (formerly Reyes), and Cameron Hardin.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>The legends fell one by one in “Santa’s Showdown” until four players remained on finale night. Then, they duked it out in the “Reindeer Games,” and by the time the hour was up, one competitor earned $100,000 just before Christmas.</p><p data-characters=21 data-current-count=21 data-injectable=false>And that was Nicole.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>Regarded as an underdog heading into the show, the three-time houseguest became Big Brother Reindeer Games’ sole champion by besting Taylor in a head-to-head showdown.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>So, how did Nicole once again ascend into reality TV glory? Let’s take a brief look at the Big Brother 18 champion’s game.</p><h2 id=h-nicole-eliminated-some-of-reindeer-games-biggest-competition-threats-en-route-to-the-100-000-grand-prize data-injectable=false>Nicole eliminated some of Reindeer Games’ biggest competition threats en route to the $100,000 grand prize</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>Through three separate stints on Big Brother — seasons 16, 18, and 22 — Nicole had never been considered a “competition beast.” She relied on her social and political wheeling and dealing to propel herself forward. So, when Nicole showed up for a game that’d ultimately be decided through competition wins, she was considered a heavy underdog when stacked up against the likes of Frankie, Cody, and Xavier.</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=71 data-injectable=false>Luckily, Reindeer Games involved strategy and social dynamics as well.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>Nicole ensured that she was insulated by multiple alliances. Although Cody had betrayed her during season 22, she, Cody, and Frankie quickly grouped up as part of the Big Brother 16 alliance. Also, Nicole buried the hatchet with Britney while establishing an all-female alliance with the woman in the house.</p><p data-characters=555 data-current-count=934 data-injectable=true>Nicole floated through the first two rounds of play. Although she didn’t win a competition, she also wasn’t sent into Santa’s Showdown — the loser-go-home challenge that capped off the episodes. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cameron, “America’s Favorite Player” from Big Brother 25,</a> was the first to be sent packing courtesy of Big Brother 23’s king, Xavier. And Cody, season 22’s champion and 16’s runner-up, followed him out the door a day later when he came up short against Xavier and Frankie, his fellow Big Brother 16 alum.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>Nicole notched her first Reindeer Games victory in episode 3 when she toppled the roster in the “Jingle Bell Brawl.” The win earned her safety that day, and later, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Danielle, an icon from Big Brother 3 and 7,</a> had her franchise comeback derailed.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>Then, Nicole showed off her championship mettle in episode 4 when she found herself in Santa’s Showdown opposite Josh, Big Brother 19’s winner. In a game that had them clinging onto a swinging candy cane for dear life, Nicole narrowly outlasted Josh, who toppled to the ground a second before Nicole.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>The victory landed her in the final five, and she followed it up with her first and only “Naughty and Nice” win. She served Xavier a punishment, but it wasn’t enough to eliminate him. Xavier and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Brother 12</a> and 14’s Britney were partnered up for the Jingle Bell Brawl, and later, they faced off in Santa’s Showdown.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=719 data-injectable=true>Nicole’s ally Britney bit the dust, and the finalists for the first annual Reindeers Game were established. Before the finale aired on December 21, Nicole shared a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">video via Instagram</a> of herself and her husband, Big Brother 18’s Victory Arroyo, baking snacks while writing in the caption that when she made it to the end game, she already felt like a winner.</p><p>“I made it into the reindeer games (final 4) and that felt like a win to me. Actually me just going and being surrounded with such amazing friends is the real win.”</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>In episode 6, Xavier won the final Naughty and Nice challenge, and he earned the ability to determine the semi-final bracket. Viewing Nicole as a lesser threat than Frankie and Taylor, Big Brother 24’s queen, Xavier matched himself up with Nicole while the other two squared off.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>Because Xavier chose her, Nicole was hit with a 30-second time penalty at the start of their challenge, which had them building a puzzle with gears that eventually cracked nuts. As history has it, Nicole flew through the puzzle and ended Xavier’s impressive challenge run.</p><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>Then, Taylor beat Frankie in their contest, setting up an all-female, all-winner final.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>The challenge was broken down into three stages that had them climbing objects to snag “magical mistletoe,” maneuvering antlers through a three-stacked maze, and stacking dozens of different-sized snowflakes. Taylor led most of the game. But, the final portion proved difficult, and Nicole came from behind and pulled the rug out from under her.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>By capturing the Reindeer Games trophy, Nicole was awarded $100,000 and the bragging rights that came with another franchise first-place finish.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>Nicole<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> took to Instagram</a> to react to her Reindeer Games triumph after the last episode ended while also revealing that she was retiring from her Big Brother career. She wrote:</p><p>“THANKFUL for this experience, thankful for my CBS family in LA & thankful for this cast. I am so grateful for every single part of this journey ESP the amazing relationships I’ve made. PS im retired. FOR REAL.”</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>No contestant has ever won two seasons of an American-based Big Brother season. Some contestants have come close — Cody and Dan Gheesling both placed as winners and runner-ups in their two showings. However, Nicole now stands as the only former houseguest to achieve victory in two iterations of CBS’s flagship series.</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=false>Because of this year’s writer’s strike, Big Brother Reindeer Games came to life. And with Hollywood back into full swing, this may be the first and only time the CBS original hits our television screens. And if that’s the case, Nicole’s name will remain as the only Reindeer Games champion etched in the history books.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mrqKmo2KvqrOMm6morJiav26%2BxKKlnZ2Vp3qorcyeqmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-wins-big-brother-reindeer-games.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-wins-big-brother-reindeer-games.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-wins-big-brother-reindeer-games.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-wins-big-brother-reindeer-games.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-wins-big-brother-reindeer-games.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-wins-big-brother-reindeer-games.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mary-yoon-fox-11-news-married-kids-south-korea-education-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mary-yoon-fox-11-news-married-kids-south-korea-education-wiki.html>Mary Yoon; FOX 11 News, Married, Kids, South Korea, Education, Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-much-money-does-malcolm-jamal-7-html.html>How Much Money Does Malcolm-Jamal Warner Make?
