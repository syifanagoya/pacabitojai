He developed his brand on Just Joking, honed his comedic storytelling abilities, and attracted the attention of some of the best comics in the business.

Hughley, Bill Bellamy, Bill Burr, Cedric the Entertainer, Angela Johnson, Bobby Lee, Katt Williams, Eddie Griffin, Maz Jobrani, J. Anthony Brown, Bruce Bruce, Mike Epps, Rickey Smiley, and Kevin Hart.</p><p>Siddiq performed on four seasons of BET's Comic View, finished in the top three of NBC Universal's Stand Up for Diversity, made an appearance in the season finale of HBO's Def Comedy Jam, and performed on BET's One Mic Stand and Bill Bellamy's Who's Got Jokes, which aired on TV One. Siddiq has contributed his voice and opinion to TV One's Washington Watch, hosted by Roland Martin, in addition to his stand-up performances. This appearance demonstrated his dedication to making sure his audience not only laughed, but also learned something.</p><p>Siddiq, who is well known for his ability to engage audiences, also uses this talent to engage with his community. The Jive Turkey Comedy Jam, which is produced by Siddiq, recently gathered canned items for the North Texas Food Bank. He also served as the keynote speaker at the 2012 Freshman Orientation at Texas Southern University.

"How much does it cost to book Ali Siddiq for an event?" is a frequent question we get. The final Ali Siddiq booking price is contingent on many variables and the booking fee we may show is based on a range derived from our past experience with what will Ali Siddiq charge for an event. An example fee to book Ali Siddiq is in the starting range of $25,000-$39,999. However, any recent popularity change would cause a price fluctuation well beyond this example. Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement.</p><p>There is low probability to book Ali Siddiq for a party with anything substantially less than the published booking cost price range. We will negotiate with the Ali Siddiq agent on your behalf if your funding is in place. By not having funding ready then it will more difficult to book Ali Siddiq, because they get many offers to work events that are at or above asking price. It is also important to consider the travel costs when researching the Ali Siddiq booking fee, as additional expenses like this, as well as an entourage of staff and equipment, are not necessarily built-in to the booking fee range shown. If your budget does not factor that in, then there is no benefit for them to want to be hired. We do not personally speak for Ali Siddiq, but in our experience in booking talent for over 25 years, this is generally the outcome of inadequate funding.</p><p><b>Type</b><br>Performer</p><p><b>Style</b><br>Comedian</p><p><b>Range</b><br>Comedian, Male, Age Group-18-30's, African American</p><b>Bookmark and Share</b><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaK4xKerZ6aVqXy0rcypo56skaGyr8COam1sa2dkrq21jKygnZyZpnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./52213-addo-elephant-national-park-entrance-fee-accommodation-activities-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./52213-addo-elephant-national-park-entrance-fee-accommodation-activities-html.html>Addo Elephant National Park entrance fee, accommodation and activities</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jeanne-baird.html>Jeanne Baird Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jeanne-baird.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
